# Log Entry #2: STAY AWAY from Saturn

I see why no one vacations on Saturn, it's a NIGHTMARE. So here I am, flying in my faithful ship the Dawn Treader, and I see Saturn on the horizon. Now mind you I'm currently on a voyage from the martians to truly see if Pluto is in fact not a planet (they still can't get over the news). But anyway, I thought, I've never been to Saturn before, I heard its rings are beautiful, why not take a small detour and see it for myself. Well....turns out this is, to put it midly, a pretty terrible, no good, awful type of idea. THERES NO WHERE TO BLOODY LAND, IT'S ALL GAS. Like yes, obviously the gas giant, is made of gas, BUT IT DOESNT STOP. So I start floating into the planet, and I keep going, and going.....and going......and....going. Upon seeing that there is in fact no where to land I decided to turn around and head out, but then, and this is the icing on our space-vacuum cold cake, I hear a sound. And not like a meow meow, or woof woof kind of fun sound, moreso a GRAWRRR type of not good sound. I looked around anxiously, koping to find a meow meow kind of animal that may just be in late stage puberty...but no. What was there, was in fact, a 10 mile long, 10 foot long teeth having, crimson red skin posessing, giant red flamburg. Now for those unaware, a flamburg is a not so friendly space bird, resembling that of a red dragon of nerd games galore. So as its not so beautiful now that they were gazed on me looking eyes were orange with fiery fury, I nicely tilted the ship upward, flipped on the improbability drive switch, and shot out of the planet at 10,000 miles a second. So good news, I'm alive, bad news...those martians are gonna be waiting quite a while to recieve the closure they need. Cause whoever may be listening to this, we're not in the Solar System anymore.
